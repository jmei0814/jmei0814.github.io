title: About Me

Hi, my name is Jason Mei, I'm currently studying Information Sciences at the iSchool of UIUC, and planning on doing an intercollegiate transfer to Computer Engineering at the Grainger College of Engineering.

#Hobbies

I'm (obviously) a big fan of spreadsheets. When I'm not working on the various projects I pursue, I enjoy working on combat robots with iRobotics, as well as playing video games (CS:GO) with my friends. I also enjoy playing volleyball sometimes.
